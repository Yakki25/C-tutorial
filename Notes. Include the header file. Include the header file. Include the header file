1. Include the header file
2. write the main function and write statements
3. gcc filename.c to compile
4. ./a.exe

5 + 6 
expression: collection of operator and operands in meaning ful way to perform a logic
operator:input that performs an opertion(As in above case + )
operand: input on which an operation needed to be performed (As in above case 5,6)

a*b=is a wrong expression

Data can be basically  either variable or constant 
(3.14
9.8
9*10^9
5
8) are all constant

{student_name,my_age,salary} are all variables.
Variables are such memory space the is assigned to take a particular data but the value of that data can differ
1. name of variable can be anything but in general we should take a name that signifies the data for increased code readability
for example use variable (t,T,temp,temperature) for temperature 
Naming convention for variables
a. Name of a variable can only contain uppercase, lowercase alphabets, numbers and underscore(_) ex. temp, temp1, temp_body1 
 temp# ->wrong temp( ->wrong
b. Name of a variable must start with alphabets and in special case(_) but cannot start with number ex. _temp, temp, Temp
1temp=>wrong
c. Name of a variable cannot contain spaces. ex tempbody1, temp_body1, temp_of_body
 temp body 1 ->wrong
d. variables in c are case sensitive ex: temp, Temp, tEMP, temP are all different variables
e. variable must be declared before their use
f. vaiables declaration syntax is datatype variable_name=value(optional)

int num1;
int num1=0;
int v,a,T;
int u=5;

v=u+at

Format specifiers are blankspace that declares the type of data to be handled

integer %d
float   %f
long    %l
double  %lf
char    %c
string  %s

Escape sequences: Helpers to print some variable or constants in formatted way
\n newline
\t tab
\0 terminate printing
\r carriage return
\b backspace

Data Types: 
Primitive Data Type(inbuilt)
numeric
int,float,double,long
character 
char
boolean 
bool

Non Primitive(user defined)
Array homogeneous [numeric,numeric,numeric]
structure heterogeneous [numeric,character,boolean]
union heterogeneous
type casting

/////////////////////////Operators///////////////////////////////////////////
Operator: 
1. Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,++,--) to perform mathematical operations
2. Assignment operator(=,+=,*=,/=,^=,%=)
3. relational operator (<,>,<=,>=,!=,==)
4. logical operator (&&,||,!    )
5. bitwise operation (<<,>>,|,&,~)

Algorithm
old_level=5
loop start
increment=1
old_level+=increment    //old_level=old_level+increment
repeat 10 times
loop end
print old_level

x<<100101
x>>100101
x=110010


/////////////////////////Conditional Statements//////////////////////////
Scene 1. if with else
We have to implement a toggle  button
Description: Switch when pressed 2n-1 time then it changes 
             state to on when it is pressed for 2n time then it changes state to off.

Logic:
            if(n%2==0){
                switch is off
            }else{
                switch is on
            }
syntax:
            if(condition){
                statements
                ...
            }else{
                statements
                ...
            }
Conclusion: when true case should yield a result as well as the false case should also yield a result then we have to use 
if...else

Scene 2: Simple if
We have to implement a case where when page is not found it should give a 404
logic:
    if(page==0){
        send 404
    }
syntax: if(condition){
    statements
    ...
}
conclusion: When the program has to give an output only in true case

Scene 3: Chained if
We have to implement a system to add, subtract,multiply and divide numbers based on the given input
Desciption: Develop a console based calculator

logic and syntax:
if(condition1){
    operation1
}else if(condition2){
    operation2
}else if(condition3){
    operation3
}
...
else{
    default statements
}

Conclusion:We can use when we have to choose between multiple options and only option is correct

Scene 4: Nested if
We have to develop an AI system to recognise an apple based on shape,color and taste


if(shape=="oval"){  //Check condition 1
    if(color=="red"){  //check condition 2 if and only if condition 1 is satisfied
        if(taste=="sweet"){ //check condition 3 if  and only if condition 1 and 2 are both correct
            it is an apple
        }
    }
}

Conclusion: nested if is used when we have to make some program which will only execute if all the top level
condition satisfies
